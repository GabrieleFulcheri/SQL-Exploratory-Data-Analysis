# SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis 

### Data cleaning and EDA of a dataset containing sales from 2011 to 2016

In this project, my principal aim was to write reusable queries that could give to a potential manager or business an insight on its sales trends.
The queries I have written should cover the main and most frequent questions related to a sales report, such as: Which is the most sold item? Who
has been the most profitable customer segment in a certain year? How did sales change over a certain period considered?

This project hasn't a specific marketing task or question to answer, since it is not part of a case study or similar. However, the main parts and phases
of the analysis are described in the SQL text file, along with a description of each query and the purpose it serves in the context.
